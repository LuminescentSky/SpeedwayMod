		<h1 style="color: #b688ba">Speedway Mod Changelog</h1>
		<h2>1.0.1</h2>
		<ul>
<p><li>Full game IGT is now capped at 99:59:59.95 instead of 9:59:59.95
</li></p></ul>
		<h2>1.0</h2>
		<ul>
<p><li>When entering a level or warping, the screen will now fade to black instead of freezing for approximately half a second
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where pressing X, Start or Triangle (where available) in the IGT menu one frame after changing the selection didn't play the sound effect properly
</li></p></ul>
		<h2>1.0 Pre-Release 2</h2>
		<ul>
<p><li>Jayo will now only suggest Dry Canyon if the egg in Dry Canyon has not been collected yet. If it has, they will suggest any of the other four levels that don't have the egg(s) collected yet instead
</li></p><p><li>Moved the IGT in the Guidebook and all Mod Options slightly away from the very edge of the screen
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where travelling to a level via balloon that was suggested by Jayo didn't reset the level properly including collectables, life count, IGT and key state
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where the visual flight IGT in the top right would overflow and crash the game after 2 hours and 23 minutes
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where the regular level and full game IGT would overflow and display a negative number after 10 days
</li></p><p><li>Under the hood changes to menu text to save space by pointing to more built in strings from flights which are always loaded on PAL
</li></p></ul>
		<h2>1.0 Pre-Release 1</h2>
		<ul>
<p><li>Jayo will now always suggest Dry Canyon when talking to them with less than 5 eggs
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where a change in the previous update caused the balloonists' menus to become too transparent
</li></p></ul>
		<h2>0.4.2 Beta</h2>
		<ul>
<p><li>Added a sound effect when collecting dragons
</li></p><p><li>IGT menus and Guidebook dialogue boxes are now slightly more transparent to match the pause menu dialogue box
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where level IGT continued incrementing after finishing a flight when Spyro flies up in the air before displaying the flight menu
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where the wing flap wasn't reset during loads and respawns meaning retrying or entering a flight right after initiating a wing flap could carry it into a fresh attempt
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where Spyro's momentum wasn't reset when loading into or retrying a level meaning stored momentum from the level load or previous attempt could be released by jumping at the start of an attempt causing inconsistencies. Spyro's momentum will still not be reset during regular deaths to stay true to the original game
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where grounded supercharging, wing flapping and superfly jumping could still be executed when movement was locked
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where the visual dragon counter kept incrementing infinitely when interrupting it right after collecting a dragon by opening the pause menu or Guidebook
</li></p></ul>
		<h2>0.4.1 Beta</h2>
		<ul>
<p><li>Toasty dogs now only have one life to prevent their gems from vanishing
</li></p><p><li>Wing flapping now always gives the same amount of height regardless of how long the X button was held, making it more similar to Spyro 2
</li></p><p><li>Reverted previous update's change of increasing the height of superfly jumps (the change of the overall duration is kept)
</li></p></ul>
		<h2>0.4 Beta</h2>
		<ul>
<p><li>Added Skyro (my custom skin)
</li></p><p><li>Eggs are now displayed with a numeric counter in the HUD to prevent them from overlaying the IGT
</li></p><p><li>The dragon count is now displayed in the HUD when collecting a dragon and spins accordingly upon increasing the total dragon count
</li></p><p><li>Sharp turning can now be disabled in Mod Options so digital controller players will not have to deal with broken supercharge turns and can just regular turn instead when holding down left/down right
</li></p><p><li>Sharp turn offset information when changing it with R3 + Up/Down is now centred
</li></p><p><li>Decreased the overall duration and increased the height of superfly jumps to make them more similar to Spyro 2
</li></p><p><li>IGT now counts at a more accurate framerate (24.88 fps rather than 25)
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where completing an Artisans level, Gnorc Cove and Twilight Harbour did not open Toasty, Twilight Harbour and Gnasty Gnorc respectively
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where attempting to start or continue sharp turning during movement lock (breaking a key chest, killing an egg thief etc.) caused the sharp turn to not work properly anymore once movement was unlocked again for as long as the inputs were kept held down
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where completing a flight level and leaving it immediately without retrying it, then entering another flight level caused that flight level to be flagged as complete as well, removing its time trial mode
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where supercharging in flight levels caused certain cycles to freeze
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where supercharging in flight levels caused no timer sound effects to play
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where failing a flight level by touching the death plane didn't play any sound effects on the flight menu screen
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where failing a flight level by touching the death plane while supercharging caused the time trial timer to continue counting down, replacing the "Crashed" title with "Time is up"
</li></p><p><li>Under the hood changes to how text is drawn to reduce the amount of space used in the PS1 RAM
</li></p><p><li>Infinite Flight can no longer be toggled in Mod Options and is always on
</li></p></ul>
		<h2>0.3.2 Beta</h2>
		<ul>
<p><li>Heightcaps in Gnasty's Loot have been very slightly lowered
</li></p><p><li>Health is now fully restored during level transitions as this could already be achieved very quickly by retrying a level before leaving anyway
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where supercharging in flight levels caused the time trial timer to freeze before completing the level
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where jumping, landing, frame perfectly initiating supercharge and then supercharge jumping caused Spyro to get stuck in the "jumping" state, making it impossible to charge until releasing square and possible to gain massive amounts of height by pressing X while being in that limbo state
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where frame perfectly pressing X and Square while roll bouncing could send Spyro to the heightcap instantly
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where using the guidebook to warp out of an incomplete flight level and then revisiting it caused it to be marked as complete temporarily, removing the time trial mode until the next attempt
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where quitting game and starting a new game would not properly reset flight completion flags, removing the time trial mode on the second attempt if the flight had been completed in a previous play through
</li></p><p><li>Under the hood changes to the code that removes dragon animations to reduce the amount of space used in the PS1 RAM
</li></p></ul>
		<h2>0.3.1 Beta</h2>
		<ul>
			<p><li>Fixed an issue where the game crashes when freeing a dragon after dying or voiding out</li></p>
			
		</ul>
		<h2>0.3 Beta</h2>
		<ul>
<p><li>Added Superfly Jumping (similar to Spyro 2/3)
</li></p><p><li>Added Spyro 2/3 like wing flapping while flying to gain height
</li></p><p><li>Flight is now enabled during fly out animations
</li></p><p><li>Flight speed can no longer be influenced by momentum storage (flying above the heightcap is also impossible as a result)
</li></p><p><li>To make Gnasty's Loot work properly with the above change, custom heightcap code was added where heightcaps are unlocked either by being grounded for the first heightcap raise or using keys for all other heightcap raises
</li></p><p><li>Dragons are now collected instantly without an animation
</li></p><p><li>Added Individual Level IGT with menu screens upon completion, pausing + quitting and dying with 0 lives in a level. This menu also replaces the flight level Time Attack screen and displays the level name
</li></p><p><li>Level collectibles are now reset when replaying levels but aren't removed from the guidebook by storing the highest number of collectables gotten in a play through
</li></p><p><li>Lives are now temporary and per level, starting with 0 lives. You cannot lose or gain lives in homeworlds
</li></p><p><li>Removed fly in animations to standardise Individual Level IGT
</li></p><p><li>Simplified when IGT is counted
</li></p><p><li>Redesigned IGT menus by adding a transparent background, adding sound effects and slightly changing font sizes, font colours and textbox sizes to make room for Individual Level info
</li></p><p><li>Added level name to the Pause menu
</li></p><p><li>Added the ability to quit game out of any level by pressing left or right on the "Quit" option in the pause menu
</li></p><p><li>Renamed Inventory to Guidebook
</li></p><p><li>Added level warping in the Guidebook which can only be activated by using the All Levels cheat
</li></p><p><li>The All Levels cheat will now also unlock Twilight Harbour, Gnasty Gnorc and Gnasty's Loot
</li></p><p><li>Changed the menu background colour for better readability
</li></p><p><li>Changed the font colour of the IGT on the guidebook to gold
</li></p><p><li>Extra zeros on the hour and minute counters are now removed from all IGT displays when they aren't needed
</li></p><p><li>Movement is now locked while calibrating sharp turns to prevent Spyro from moving while modifying offset values
</li></p><p><li>Supercharge Speed in Mod Options is now limited to 4 levels, however 4 is still the highest speed being the same as 12 in previous versions
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where triggering a fairy interaction caused black bars to appear and stay making it impossible to pause the game and potentially crashing the game
</li></p><p><li>Fixed a very rare crash that could occur when initiating grounded supercharge immediately after the first frame of flying in a flight level, and then pausing and exiting level or warping to a level that is not a flight level
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where exiting level from the IGT menu caused a short temporary graphical visual corruption until the actual load screen
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue of the original game where the key's pointer is never reset causing the key to sometimes despawn when replaying a level or even the game without restarting the console (<a href="https://github.com/C0mposer/Spyro-1-Practice-Rom/blob/master/notes/Key%20Glitch.md" style="color: #b688ba">key glitch</a>)
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue of the original game where flight gems aren't given to the player until the flight menu is fully closed (upon retrying or exiting level). This fix means that new gems will properly show up on the guidebook and level warping will also retain them even if the current attempt hasn't ended yet
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue of the original game where it's possible to die to the death plane in flight levels. The fix now properly displays the "Crashed" screen
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue of the original game where the total worth of gems visible on the load screen doesn't add up to the amount of gems earned during flights. This will still not be the case when fully completing a flight in a single visit, however that is due to the load screen not being able to display more than 32 gems. As long as the number of gems is 32 or less (8 earned per worth of 60), this is now resolved
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue of the original game where the first page of the flight menu would accept menu inputs for the second screen without that menu being visible yet
</li></p><p><li>The Delbin dragon dupe had to be patched completely due to the fact that allowing dragons to be skipped instantly caused a dupe no matter what, even if the full credits had been watched. Purposely adding it back would've added unnecessary convoluted code for a non-utilised quirk of the game
		</li></p></ul>
		<h2>0.2 Beta</h2>
		<ul>
<p><li>Added custom Time Attack screens after beating Gnasty Gnorc and after 120% completion
</li></p><p><li>Added IGT to Inventory Screen
</li></p><p><li>Improved flight speed when initiating flight without momentum (this includes flight levels, making them more speedway viable)
</li></p><p><li>Added fixed heightcaps (set at same heights as SRT)
</li></p><p><li>Added manual sharp turn calibration (change offset by pressing R3 + Up/Down)
</li></p><p><li>Fixed an issue where the game could crash when supercharge jumping after rolling or roll bouncing.
</li></p><p><li>Removed the ability to change supercharge speed in-game (you can still set the supercharge speed from within the Mod Options)
			
		</li></p></ul>
		<h2>0.1.1 Beta</h2>
		<ul>
			<p><li>Fixed an issue where the game crashes when trying to view the 120% Ending</li></p>
			
		</ul>
		<h2>0.1 Beta</h2>
		<ul>
			<p><li>Initial Beta Release</li></p>
		</ul>
